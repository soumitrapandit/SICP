# SICP Study Documentation - Chapters 1 to 3

## Introduction

This README documents my journey through the first three chapters of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP) using the SICP language extension for DrRacket. Throughout this endeavor, I have tackled every exercise presented, diving into the foundational concepts of computer science and programming.

## Environment Setup

- **Language**: SICP (Scheme dialect for DrRacket)
- **IDE**: DrRacket with SICP Language Extension

## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Procedures

#### Concepts Learned
- Essentials of procedure abstraction and application.
- High-order procedures.
- Recursion and iterative processes.
- Constructing processes using compound procedures.

#### Highlights of Problems Solved
- Fibonacci numbers (recursive and iterative solutions).
- Square roots approximation (Newton's method).
- Higher-order functions (`map` procedure implementation).

### Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data

#### Concepts Learned
- Data representation for compound structures.
- Data abstraction techniques.
- Closure properties in system construction.
- Hierarchical data manipulation.
- Symbolic data usage.
- Abstract data for modeling real-world problems.

#### Highlights of Problems Solved
- Rational numbers data abstraction (operations implementation).
- Picture language for demonstrating abstraction barriers.
- Set manipulation using list structures.

### Chapter 3: Modularity, Objects, and State

#### Concepts Learned
- Modularity in system design.
- Stateful objects management in functional programming.
- Assignment and structure behavior.
- Mutable data abstraction management.
- Concurrency in computing.

#### Highlights of Problems Solved
- Digital circuit simulator implementation.
- Bank account abstraction (assignment effects exploration).
- Demand-driven sequences representation using streams.

## Reflections
I think that this project was really important for me as I have no formal educatioin in CS. Diving into SICP allowed me to cultivate my love for CS while simulataneously learning the fundamentals in a very robust way. Learning about lists, environments and maps was really satisfying. 
If I had to do it again, I most certainly would. 
Special thanks goes to Prof. Rose Bohrer at WPI who allowed me to take this as an independent study. 

## Future Goals

With the foundational knowledge acquired from the first three chapters of SICP, I plan to explore more advanced topics in computer science. My interest is particularly piqued by compilers, and I aim to apply the learned concepts in practical projects such as a Domain Specific Language.
